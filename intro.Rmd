## Basic Idea

In this notebook I will explore how to use the version control system (VCS) functionality included in RStudio.

To begin, we create a new repository in github along with the conventional files such as the README. Next we create a new project in RStudio, select Version Control, and then choose Git. It is a good idea to send a pull request to the repository to ensure that it matches our local repository. Now that we have our project created, we can add new files as needed and use R as we normally would. Whenever we want to save our work, press 'commit' to save the changes to our local repository and then press 'push' to copy our repository github.
